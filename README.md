No Buddy's Grey

A Global Game Jam project, developed in 2016

Dependencies:

To run this game, you'll need
* python 2.7.x (https://www.python.org/)
* pygame 1.9.1 (https://www.pygame.org/)

To compile this game, you'll additionally need:
* py2exe 0.6.9 (https://www.py2exe.org/)

Please note: This program won't work correctly under x64 Python environments,
so make sure to install all stuff as x86. This won't cause problems, even under Windows x64 systems.

After installation, execute game.py to launch the game. A debug console will open. If you don't have an explorer entry, execute the following command in cmd:
C:\python27\python.exe game.py
in the working directory of the source.

Have fun and play (sorry, but the screen texts and voice acts are only in german), but the credits are in english, however).

Packaging (pseudo-compilation):
If you've py2exe installed, executing setup.py with the python interpreter will invoke the packaging process. It should run through without any problems.
If you get bored with some "Can't find dll" stuff, try googling them together and putting them into C:\Windows\syswow64\
If the program finishes without any error message, you can find a No Buddy's Grey-1.0.zip in the working directory, containing the whole release, which can be started by launching game.exe.

Thanks for bringing us together and keep up this great work organizing the Global Game Jam. See you next year.
